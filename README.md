# IdleDragons-ahk-Scripts
A collection of AutoHotKey scripts for Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms.

## Chest Opening Scripts
*These scripts will open chests for you, one at a time, until they have opened N chests*    
Open-N-Gold-Chests.ahk    
Open-N-Silver-Chests.ahk     

## Gem Farming (and other automatic reset) scripts
*These scripts will repeatedly run an adventure for a predetermined length of time.*     
*Please note that these scripts will load your 3rd saved formation using the E hotkey.*
###### EFP = Event Free Play
*Please note that to use this for Year 2 free play you must have completed all Year 1 variants*
Newstyle will eventually be "user records their map actions once, the script does the rest"     
Oldstyle blindly clicks the map. The user will need to manually adjust the script
###### MW = Mad Wizard
*Please note that these scripts assume you have completed every base quest in Grand Tour, for map positioning.*
*You'll also need to have completed all variants of The Cursed Farmer, for selection positioning*
Pokota and Pokota-Experimental are optimized for my 3rd saved formation.    
Pokota-Experimental is also used as a testing ground for new features/optimizations.    
Simple and Simple-Minsc make fewer assumptions about your 3rd saved formation.
###### RoR = Ring of Regeneration
Min assumes no champions (or only one champion).    
Deekin assumes you're at least using Deekin.

## Gold Farming
*These scripts are designed for farming gold using Makos's ult.*    
Ishi scripts will use Ishi's ult before using Makos's ult.
